                <p className="m-0">
                  Popular in the 20th century, neon light signs are making a
                  serious comeback thanks to a new, safer, more energy efficient
                  and affordable material - LED neon flex. While vintage neon
                  signs used glass neon tubes, modern neon is allowing a new
                  generation to enjoy a high quality neon experience with a
                  greater range of options while costing significantly less!

                  safety of neon LED products, you can now buy neon LED signs
